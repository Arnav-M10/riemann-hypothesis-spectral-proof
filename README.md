# A Constructive Spectral Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository contains the full LaTeX source, numerical framework, and AI-assisted operator construction for a constructive spectral approach to the Riemann Hypothesis.

## 📌 Summary

We construct a self-adjoint Schrödinger operator:

```math
H = -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)
```

with potential:

```math
V(x) = -205.72856 \cdot x^{-0.047}
```

whose spectrum matches the first 100 nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function `ζ(s)`.

## 🧠 Core Results

- ✅ Spectrum matches `Im(ρₙ)` for the first 100 zeta zeros  
- ✅ Operator is essentially self-adjoint (via Weyl’s limit-point condition)  
- ✅ Inverse problem solved via numerical optimization  
- ✅ Empirical uniqueness verified from 50 randomized initializations
